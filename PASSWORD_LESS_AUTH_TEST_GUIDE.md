# Password-less Authentication Testing Guide

## üîê Password-less User Onboarding Feature

### What we implemented:
1. **Admin User Creation**: Admins can create user accounts without requiring passwords
2. **First-time Password Setup**: New users are prompted to set their password on first login
3. **Firestore Integration**: User status is stored in Firestore (`passwordSet` and `isTemporary` fields)
4. **Admin Interface**: New "Password-less User" button in the Admin Panel

### Testing Steps:

#### Step 1: Access Admin Panel
1. Open the app: https://mysteelprojecttracker.web.app
2. Login with admin credentials:
   - Email: `admin@mysteel.com`
   - Employee ID: `A0001`  
   - Password: `WR2024`
3. Navigate to Admin Panel (should be accessible from main menu)

#### Step 2: Create Password-less User
1. In Admin Panel, click the purple "Password-less User" button
2. Fill in the new user form:
   - **Name**: Test User
   - **Email**: testuser@mysteel.com
   - **Employee ID**: T0001
   - **Role**: Sales Team
   - **Department**: Sales (optional)
3. Click "Create User Account"
4. Should see success message: "User created successfully! Test User can now log in and set their password."

#### Step 3: Test First-time Login
1. Logout from admin account
2. Try to login with the new user:
   - Email: `testuser@mysteel.com` or Employee ID: `T0001`
   - Password: (any password - this should trigger the password setup flow)
3. Should be redirected to the "Set Your Password" screen

#### Step 4: Set Password
1. On the password setup screen:
   - Email should be pre-filled: `testuser@mysteel.com`
   - Enter a new password (must meet requirements):
     - At least 8 characters
     - At least one uppercase letter
     - At least one lowercase letter
     - At least one number
     - At least one special character (@$!%*?&)
   - Confirm the password
2. Click "Set Password"
3. Should see success message and be redirected back to login

#### Step 5: Login with New Password
1. Try to login with the newly created user:
   - Email: `testuser@mysteel.com`
   - Password: (the password you just set)
2. Should successfully login and access the dashboard

### Expected Behavior:
- ‚úÖ Admin can create users without passwords
- ‚úÖ New users get prompted to set password on first login
- ‚úÖ User status is properly tracked in Firestore
- ‚úÖ After setting password, users can login normally
- ‚úÖ Password validation works correctly
- ‚úÖ Firebase Auth integration works seamlessly

### Features Implemented:
1. **AdminUserManagement.tsx**: Modal for creating password-less users
2. **FirstTimePasswordSetup.tsx**: Password setup UI for new users
3. **adminUserService.ts**: Backend service for user management
4. **LoginForm.tsx**: Updated to detect first-time users
5. **User types**: Added `passwordSet` and `isTemporary` fields

### Code Files Modified:
- `/src/components/admin/AdminUserManagement.tsx` (new)
- `/src/components/auth/FirstTimePasswordSetup.tsx` (new)
- `/src/services/adminUserService.ts` (new)
- `/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` (updated)
- `/src/components/admin/AdminPanel.tsx` (updated)
- `/src/types/index.ts` (updated User type)

### Firebase Collections:
- **users**: Contains user documents with `passwordSet` and `isTemporary` fields
- Firebase Auth accounts are created with temporary passwords
- Users are signed out immediately after creation (admin doesn't get signed in as them)

### Security Notes:
- Temporary passwords are auto-generated and secure
- Admin never sees the temporary password
- Users must set their own password on first login
- Firebase Auth handles password security and validation
