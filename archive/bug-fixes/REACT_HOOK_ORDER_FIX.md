# React Hook Order Fix - Complete

## Issue Description
The application was experiencing a React hook order error: "Error: Rendered more hooks than during the previous render. This is likely caused by an incorrect implementation of conditional rendering or the wrong ordering of hooks."

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the `ProtectedRoute`, `AuthRoute`, and `LoginPage` components being defined **inside** the `App` component function. This caused these components to be recreated on every render, leading to inconsistent hook ordering when React reconciled the component tree.

## Solution Applied
Moved all component definitions outside of the `App` component function:

### Before (Problematic)
```tsx
function App() {
  // Components defined inside App function - PROBLEMATIC
  const ProtectedRoute: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
    const { currentUser, loading } = useAuth(); // Hook order could change
    // ...
  };
  
  const AuthRoute: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
    const { currentUser, loading } = useAuth(); // Hook order could change
    // ...
  };
  
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      {/* Routes using the above components */}
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}
```

### After (Fixed)
```tsx
// Components defined outside App function - STABLE
const ProtectedRoute: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const { currentUser, loading } = useAuth(); // Hook order is stable
  // ...
};

const AuthRoute: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const { currentUser, loading } = useAuth(); // Hook order is stable
  // ...
};

const LoginPage: React.FC = () => {
  return <LoginForm />;
};

function App() {
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      {/* Routes using the above components */}
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}
```

## Changes Made
1. **Moved `ProtectedRoute` component definition** outside of `App` function
2. **Moved `AuthRoute` component definition** outside of `App` function  
3. **Moved `LoginPage` component definition** outside of `App` function
4. **Re-enabled React StrictMode** in `main.tsx` to confirm the fix
5. **Updated wrapper div class** from `"App"` to `"min-h-screen bg-gray-50"` for consistency

## Files Modified
- `/src/App.tsx` - Moved component definitions outside App function
- `/src/main.tsx` - Re-enabled StrictMode

## Testing Results
- ✅ No more React hook order errors
- ✅ Development server runs without warnings
- ✅ React StrictMode enabled without issues
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors in core auth components
- ✅ Application loads successfully in browser

## Impact
- **Eliminates** the React hook order error completely
- **Improves** component rendering stability
- **Enables** React StrictMode for better development experience
- **Maintains** all existing functionality without changes

## Technical Notes
- Components defined inside other components are recreated on every render
- This recreation can cause React to lose track of hook ordering
- Moving components outside ensures they are defined once and reused
- This is a React best practice for performance and stability

## Status
**COMPLETED** - The React hook order error has been fully resolved and the application is stable.
