## 📋 Benefits of This Organization

1. **✅ Cleaner Root Directory** - Only essential files remain in project root
2. **✅ Better Maintainability** - Easier to navigate and understand project structure
3. **✅ Preserved History** - All development documentation safely archived
4. **✅ Future Reference** - Troubleshooting guides and implementation notes available
5. **✅ Reduced Clutter** - Development noise separated from production code

## 📝 Archive Documentation

Created `archive/ARCHIVE_README.md` with detailed explanation of:
