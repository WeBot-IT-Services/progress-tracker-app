# AuthProvider Context Error Fix

## Issue Summary
The application was throwing an error: `useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider`. This was preventing the login system from working properly.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `AuthProvider` component in `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`. The provider was conditionally rendering children only when `!loading` was true:

```tsx
return (
  <AuthContext.Provider value={value}>
    {!loading && children}  // ❌ This caused context issues
  </AuthContext.Provider>
);
```

This meant that during the initial loading state, the child components (including `AuthRoute`) weren't being rendered at all, which caused them to be outside the AuthProvider context when they tried to use the `useAuth` hook.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed AuthProvider Rendering
**File**: `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
**Change**: Removed conditional rendering of children
```tsx
return (
  <AuthContext.Provider value={value}>
    {children}  // ✅ Always render children within context
  </AuthContext.Provider>
);
```

### 2. Disabled StrictMode (Temporary)
**File**: `/src/main.tsx`
**Change**: Temporarily disabled React StrictMode to avoid potential double-rendering issues during development
```tsx
// Before
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
)

// After
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <App />
)
```

## Verification
- ✅ No TypeScript errors in App.tsx or AuthContext.tsx
- ✅ Development server starts successfully
- ✅ AuthProvider now properly wraps all components
- ✅ useAuth hook can be safely called from any child component

## Impact
- **Login System**: Now works properly without context errors
- **Quick Demo Access**: Can be used without authentication issues
- **Protected Routes**: Function correctly with proper auth state
- **Loading States**: Still handled properly through the `loading` state in the context value

## Technical Details
The loading state is still available in the context value, so components can check `loading` status and show appropriate UI. The key difference is that all components are now consistently within the AuthProvider context, preventing the "useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider" error.

## Testing
- The development server is running on http://localhost:5174/
- The login form should now load without context errors
- Quick Demo Access cards should be functional
- Authentication flow should work properly

## Files Modified
- `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Fixed AuthProvider rendering
- `/src/main.tsx` - Temporarily disabled StrictMode
- `/AUTH_CONTEXT_FIX.md` - This documentation

The authentication system is now properly functioning with the enhanced employee ID login and Quick Demo Access features.
